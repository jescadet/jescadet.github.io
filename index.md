I finished my PhD at the [Software Composition Group](http://scg.unibe.ch/), [University of Bern](https://www.inf.unibe.ch/) in 2012.

My main topic of research during my PhD was "Object-Centric Reflection". My thesis addresses the object paradox while reshaping the reflection space in unified and uniform way. You can access my thesis [online](http://scg.unibe.ch/scgbib?query=Ress12d&display=abstract) or acquire the book version at [lulu](http://www.lulu.com/shop/jorge-ressia/object-centric-reflection/paperback/product-20402039.html).

My research interests are Object-Oriented Programming and Design with particular emphasis on reflection and meta-programming. I am also interested in the epistemology and ontology behind the computational models that we build in order to represent reality.
